# Arianna Langton - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, I'm Arianna! I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematics, providing me with a strong analytical foundation in both the physical sciences and mathematics. My passion for problem-solving and mathematics has naturally led me toward a career in data analytics. I have earned both the Google Data Analytics and Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificates and am currently working toward completing the Google Business Intelligence Certificate. This will not only build on my data analytics expertise but also deepen my understanding of the business analytics field. 

Throughout my studies, I refined my ability to analyze complex datasets and developed a keen eye for spotting patterns and trends. My experience with data management and statistical analysis has helped me develop a technical mindset that I believe will be a valuable asset in my role as a data specialist. Iâ€™m eager to apply my technical and analytical skills to the data science industry as an entry-level data specialist.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always seeking opportunities to further expand my knowledge and skillset. Whether collaborating on a team or working independently, I thrive on uncovering insights and solving complex problems through data. My current technical skills include SQL, Tableau, Python, and Excel, alongside deep understanding of mathematics..

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics.

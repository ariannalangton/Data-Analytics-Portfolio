# Minnesota Traffic Volume Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic volume in Minnesota by examining monthly trends, weather conditions, and holiday effects to identify potential causes of traffic fluctuations. The analysis is supported by an interactive hourly traffic dashboard that visualizes the key findings.

## Key Findings

### Monthly Traffic Trends

August experiences the highest traffic volume.

February has the lowest traffic volume.

A notable drop-off in traffic occurred in April 2018, prompting further investigation.

### Weather Impact on Traffic

Clear weather sees the highest traffic volume.

Low-visibility conditions (e.g., heavy fog, smoke) result in the least traffic.

Precipitation (rain/snow) leads to a significant reduction in traffic compared to clear days, but traffic remains higher than in low-visibility conditions.

### Holiday Influence on Traffic

January: High traffic on MLK Day.

September: Increased traffic on Labor Day.

August: The Minnesota State Fair contributes to high traffic volume.

Additional holidays impacting traffic: New Year's Day, Independence Day, and Memorial Day.

### Hourly Traffic Dashboard

An interactive hourly traffic dashboard was created to visualize traffic patterns over different times of the day. The dashboard reflects the observed trends in monthly traffic volume, weather influence, and holiday-related variations.

### Technologies Used

Data Analysis: Python, Tableau

### Future Enhancements

Investigate the April 2018 traffic drop-off in more detail.

Analyze weekend vs. weekday traffic patterns.

Incorporate real-time traffic data for predictive modeling.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into Minnesotaâ€™s traffic patterns, helping stakeholders understand key factors that influence road congestion. The findings can aid in transportation planning, road safety measures, and traffic management strategies.

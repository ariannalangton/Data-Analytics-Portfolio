Below is a description of the goals, tools used, outcome, and action plan for the marketing campaign.

## Objective

The goal of this marketing campaign was to identify the most effective areas to target for increasing sales of boots, priced between $100-$150, to individuals aged 24-54. The campaign aimed to drive both immediate sales and long-term growth. The objective was to identify key drivers of sales, select high-potential zip codes, and choose optimal media platforms. This was achieved by analyzing factors such as population, income, and distance from the store. The ultimate aim was to optimize marketing efforts and resources, ensuring short-term success while laying the foundation for sustainable, long-term growth.

## Tools Used

- Excel for data cleaning and analysis
- Tableau to visualize findings
- PowerPoint to generate final marketing campaign report
- Regression Analysis: Used to identify relationships between sales and various factors such as population, income, distance, and farm employees.
- Correlation Coefficient: Calculated to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between sales and factors like income and population.
- Scatter Plots: Visualized the relationships between sales and different variables, helping identify trends and potential outliers.
## Outcome

- Population: Strongest predictor of sales with a positive correlation (R² = 0.94). Marketing efforts should be concentrated on high-population areas to maximize sales.

- Income: Moderate correlation (R² = 0.2911). Target areas with median incomes of $40,000-$50,000, though income is a secondary factor.

- Distance: Weak correlation (R² = 0.24). Marketing efforts should focus on zip codes closer to the store to optimize accessibility and sales.

- Farm Employees: Initially showed a positive relationship but had a negative regression coefficient (-220), indicating that farm employees may not be a strong predictor for marketing success.

- 5-Year Growth: Focus on zip codes with projected population growth over the next 5 years, as these areas are likely to experience higher demand. Keep an eye on any areas with negative growth.

## Action Plan

### Summary
According to media platform insights, YouTube is the leading platform for all age groups, followed by Facebook and Instagram, with TikTok ranking highly among younger generations within the 24-54 age group. For marketing, it’s recommended to prioritize YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram for broad reach, while TikTok can be used to target younger segments drawn to interactive content. To maximize sales, marketing efforts should focus on high-population areas, particularly those with a median income of $40,000-$50,000, as these regions are more likely to afford higher-priced products. Additionally, marketing should be concentrated in zip codes closer to the store, minimizing efforts in areas with greater distances. Avoid targeting areas with a high number of farm employees, as this has shown a negative sales correlation. Lastly, focus on zip codes with projected population growth to ensure long-term demand. Future efforts should include investigating outliers, comparing ROI from marketed versus unmarketed areas, and gathering more customer demographic data to fine-tune marketing strategies and improve targeting.

### Social Media Target Platforms

   - Media Platform Insights:
      - According to a graph from Comscore, the top media platform for all age groups is YouTube, followed by Facebook and Instagram. For younger generations, TikTok also ranks highly as a preferred platform.

- Marketing Implications:

   - For the target age group of 24-54, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram should be the primary platforms for reaching a broad audience.
TikTok can be considered for younger segments within the 24-54 range, particularly for those drawn to interactive and trend-driven content.
A balanced, effective marketing strategy can be achieved by combining YouTube for mass reach and Facebook/Instagram for more targeted, age-specific engagement.

### Population

- Priority: Focus marketing efforts on high-population areas, as population is the strongest predictor of sales.
- Action: Direct resources toward zip codes with large populations to maximize reach and sales potential. Prioritize these areas for short-term sales boosts while laying the groundwork for long-term growth.
### Income

- Priority: Target areas with higher income levels, particularly those with a median income of $40,000-$50,000, as these are more likely to afford $100-$150 shoes.
- Action: Tailor messaging and promotions to attract consumers within this income range. While income is a secondary factor, ensure targeted campaigns in areas with higher disposable income for the best return.
### Distance

- Priority: Minimize marketing efforts in areas with high distance from the store, as there is a negative correlation between sales and distance.
- Action: Focus on zip codes closer to the store location to increase accessibility and drive more foot traffic. Adjust marketing channels and offers to make these areas a priority for immediate sales.
### Farm Employees

- Priority: Although initially showing a positive correlation, farm employees have a negative regression coefficient, suggesting a decline in sales as the number of farm employees increases.
- Action: Be cautious in targeting areas with a high number of farm employees, as this may not yield positive results. Instead, focus on areas with more reliable predictors like population and income for higher sales potential.
### 5-Year Growth

- Priority: Focus on zip codes with the highest projected population growth over the next five years, as these areas will likely see an increase in demand.
- Action: Prioritize marketing strategies in areas where the population is projected to grow. Ensure that marketing campaigns are adaptable to emerging markets and continuously monitor population trends to adjust strategies for future success.



### Future Efforts:
- Investigating Outliers

   - Ensures more accurate analysis by identifying and addressing anomalies, improving the overall reliability of marketing strategies.

- Comparing Marketed vs. Unmarketed Areas ROI

  - Helps identify high-performing areas and optimizes future campaigns by evaluating the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
- Collecting More Data
